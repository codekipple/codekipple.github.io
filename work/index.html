        <h1>Carl Hughes</h1>

        <p>Front end developer based in Bristol. I work with teams and companies to create performance driven accessible sites.</p>

        <section class="push--bottom">

            <h2 class="section-title--h1">Core Skills</h2>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">CSS architecture</h3>

            <p>I am extremely interested in CSS architecture. It's surprising just how difficult CSS architecture can be, particularly on larger sites/apps which have multiple developers adding and editing CSS.</p>

            <p>I am constantly working towards improving my CSS architecture. I currently use a lot of ideas i have gleaned from <a href="https://twitter.com/stubbornella">Nicole Sullivan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/necolas">Nicolas Gallagher</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/csswizardry">Harry Roberts</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Front end JavaScript</h3>

            <p>I like JavaScript that does one thing or group of things well, preferably packaged using the commonJS module pattern. I am comfortable using both commonJS and AMD JavaScript modules.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Web markup</h3>

            <p>I care a lot about markup. I am constantly reviewing the mark up I use and why.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://html5doctor.com/">HTML5 Doctor site</a> is a brilliant resource which I consult often as parts of the HTML specification changes over time.</p>

            <p>I care about accessibility and where appropriate I will use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">ARIA</a> to make your content available to more people.</p>

            <p>I regularly use both <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="http://schema.org/docs/gs.html">Microdata</a> to provide structured data for services like search engines to make use of.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Front end ops</h3>

            <p>I am happy JavaScript based Task managers to accomplish front end ops.</p>

            <p>Front end ops can help you minify and optimise assets and automate tasks which otherwise would have been done by a human.</p>

            <p>More specifically i have used both <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> but I am more than happy to use whatever tool your team uses.</p>

            <p>If you team is yet to embrace these types of tools but would like to I can provide help, advice and training to get these tools working for you.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Site/app deployment</h3>

            <p>A smooth and easy deployment method is needed to encourage rapid development of your site.</p>

            <p>I have experience of using programs such as <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a> to make deployment as simple as a one liner in the console.</p>

            <p>If your team are still deploying manually I can help setup better work flows so your team can concentrate on building rather than deploying.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title--h1">Secondary Skills</h2>
            <p>Although I consider my core skills to be front end related I have a lot of experience doing back end programming.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Server side programming</h3>

            <p>I Have worked extensively with PHP. I've spent time working with Modern frameworks such as Symfony2. I am very familiar with the current PHP landscape and attend a local <a href="http://phpsw.org.uk/">PHP user group</a> regularly.</p>

            <p>I've built more WordPress websites then I can remember and know WordPress extremely well. I am currently working on ways to improve WordPress as a platform to develop sites by incorporating modern PHP components such as <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">twig</a>, <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html">Symfony2 forms</a> and the <a href="http://imagine.readthedocs.org/">Imagine library</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Server side ops</h3>

            <p>I have some experience managing servers with the help of <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>. I am comfortable setting up virtual machines with Vagrant using <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a> as the provisioner.</p>
