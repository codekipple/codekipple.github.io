        <h1>Carl Hughes</h1>

        <p>Full stack developer based in Bristol. I work with teams and companies to create performance driven accessible sites.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title--h1">Core Skills</h2>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Server side programming</h3>

            <p>I Have worked extensively with PHP. I've spent time working with Modern frameworks such as Symfony2. I am very familiar with the current PHP landscape and attend a local <a href="http://phpsw.org.uk/">PHP user group</a> regularly.</p>

            <p>I'm have extensive experience using Magento and WordPress to create e-commerce sites.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Server side ops</h3>

            <p>I am very comfortable setting up and managing servers.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Front end development</h3>

            <p>I care a lot about markup. I am constantly reviewing the mark up I use and why.</p>

            <p>I care about accessibility and where appropriate I will use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">ARIA</a> to make your content available to more people.</p>

            <p>I regularly use both <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="http://schema.org/docs/gs.html">Microdata</a> to provide structured data for services like search engines to make use of.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title--h2">Site/app deployment</h3>

            <p>A smooth and easy deployment method is needed to encourage rapid development of your site.</p>

            <p>I have experience of using programs such as <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a> to make deployment as simple as a one liner in the console.</p>

            <p>If your team are still deploying manually I can help setup better work flows so your team can concentrate on building rather than deploying.</p>
