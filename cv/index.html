            <h2>Core Skills</h2>

            <h3>CSS architecture</h3>

            <p>I am extremely interested in CSS architecture. It's surprising just how difficult CSS architecture can be, particularly on larger sites/apps which have multiple developers adding and editing CSS.</p>

            <p>I am constantly working towards improving my CSS architecture. I currently use a lot of ideas i have gleaned from <a href="https://twitter.com/stubbornella">Nicole Sullivan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/necolas">Nicolas Gallagher</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/csswizardry">Harry Roberts</a>.</p>

            <p>I would describe my current CSS architecture as <a href="http://oocss.org/">OOCSS</a> with a <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/">BEM</a> like naming convention.</p>

            <h3>Front end JavaScript</h3>
            <p>I like JavaScript that does one thing or group of things well, preferably packaged using the commonJS module structure.</p>

            <p>I am comfortable using both commonJS and AMD JavaScript modules.</p>

            <h3>Web markup</h3>
            <p>Microdata, RDFa.</p>

            <h3>Front end ops</h3>

            <h2>Secondary Skills</h2>
            <p>Although i consider my core skills to be front end related i have a lot of experience doing back end programming.</p>

            <p>In all of my past jobs i have worked as both a front end and back end programmer.</p>

            <h3>Server side programming</h3>

            <p>I Have worked extensively with PHP. I've spent time working with Modern frameworks such as Symfony2. I am very familiar with the current PHP landscape and attend a local <a href="http://phpsw.org.uk/">PHP user group</a> regularly.</p>

            <p>I've built more WordPress websites then i can remember and know WordPress extremely well. I am currently working on ways to improve WordPress as a platform to develop sites by incorporating modern PHP components such as <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">twig</a>, <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html">Symfony2 forms</a> and the <a href="http://imagine.readthedocs.org/">Imagine library</a>.</p>

            <h3>Server side ops</h3>

            <p>I have some experience managing servers with the help of <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>. I am comfortable setting up virtual machines with Vagrant using <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a> as the provisioner.</p>
